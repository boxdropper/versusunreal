              <h3>Entry Started: 02nd December 2024</h3>
            </div>
            <p>It has been a long, long while since my last post on this blog and in that time I have been constructing the level that I have planned along with writing my critical analysis of No Mercy.</p>
            <p>The construction of the level has been filled with some minor trials and tribulations but looking back, it has been a suprisingly smooth experience, apart from some lulls in production due to pure boredom because making modern levels take a while.</p>
            <p>But I didn't just start constructing this level with no plan, as mentioned before I was planning this level alongside my critical analysis and the fruits of this planning can be viewed as a "Pre-Production Document" available <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_4xbX73E5MDB0F9x23KaVq6LXEB-91mz27BNptamWjI/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>

              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">ROADS PATHED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS</p>
            </aside>
            <p>Development of this level, which I have titled "Getting out of Dodge", started with the roads and pathways, mainly as a way to get the route finalized before the construction of the buildings both used by the Player and NPCs and those which act as decoration.</p>
            <p>Later on in the construction of these pathways, I did attempt to include some changes in elevation outside of the buildings that the Player traverses through, as a final bit of dynamism after traversing primarily flat/level roads.</p>
            <p>After the roads came the buildings, outside of the ones that the Player and the NPCs go through, these were of fairly simple construction.</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Animated Image showing the gradual construction of the Roads and Buildings.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>When looking at both the plans that I had made and the level that came out of those plans, I'd say that the final level is close enough to what I had initially envisioned, even in this super early state that you can see above.</p>

              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">CONSIDERATE OF OTHERS</p>
            </aside>
            <p>Early on in production, I wanted to try methods of both optimisation and cutting down on workload, one of these methods was creating two types of building, one "complex" and one "simple", the noticable difference being the ceiling of the buildings, but the construction of the "simple" buildings are also only made out of two cubes rather than around 6 cubes for the "complex" buildings.</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Screenshot showing both a "complex" and a "simple" building.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I also wanted to try some form of subtle/invisible guidance with the placement of buildings, especially with turns where I have the buildings of reduced height down the intended direction, will the Player notice? Most likely not. Did I do it anyway? Yes I did.</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Screenshot showing buildings of decreasing height.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>But I did put more overt guidance within the level, often implemented as a way to prevent the Player from going the wrong way such as having a curved path of fences that are placed after the first scaffold.</p>
            <figure>

              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">TRUTH WITH LIGHT</p>
            </aside>
            <p>There were some changes that I had made to the level during development, the biggest change being the change of the time of day from sunset to nighttime, which introduced a knock-on problem where now the Player couldn't see jack.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/GooD/Darkness.png" alt="I can't see!" width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot showing the level now in near complete darkness.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This, obviously necessitated the addition of lights, I opted to create a street light actor to place throughout the streets, I also took the time to add the ability to change how the light looks, whether it'll be fully on, flicker, or be turned off, a decision made to attempt to keeps elements of the level within the original worldbuilding brief provided to us.</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Animated Image showcasing the flickering Streetlights.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Another form of lighting that I have utilized that also fit the world building brief, are the flaming barrels, these barrels are used in areas where having streetlights may not make any sense, such as alleyways or abandoned buildings.</p>
            <figure>

            </aside>
            <p>Having all of these lights within a Level in the Unreal Engine, usually leads to the problem where, eventually, the lighting will need to be rebuilt, however, when the time came to build the level's lighting, the engine crashed, no matter what, didn't matter how many lights there were, how many objects that needed rebuilt lighting, every time a rebuild attempt was made, the engine crashed.</p>
            <p>Luckily, there was a way around the issue, setting every light entity to "Moveable" rather than "Static" or "Stationary", with this move, the need to rebuild lights disappeared. But, there was now a new problem, "Moveable" lights are not the best for performance, I'd now need to find a way to optimize this level and I found it thanks to Unreal Engine 5's new "World Partition" system.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>Using the World Partition, I'm able to select and add actors and objects to what is called "Data Layers" and be able to toggle which of these layers are currently active at a time, using a trigger volume actor that I had created myself.</p>

              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">UNALLOCATED SPACE</p>
            </aside>
            <p>Late in development came time for Playtesting, where various people had to opportunity to test my level in an early state. This playtesting proved to be very useful to identify issues that I completely passed me by because I know my level and how to get through it, but others don't. One of the bigger issues that these others have brought up was the issue that most of the streets are fairly barren with nothing short of buildings and street lights within them.</p>
            <p>This is a problem as it leads to Players getting lost, turned around and simply not being able to complete the level, so this problem had to be addressed, but how can I address this issue without breaking immersion/fitting within the environment of the level?</p>
            <p>I settled on using cars with headlights, a measure similiar to the one used in Left 4 Dead's No Mercy.</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Animated Image showing various cars with headlights.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The lights of the cars, point to the intended direction for the Player to follow, I also used both the aforementioned the flaming barrels and regular lights also as a way to guide the Player down a particular direction.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>Speaking of those playtests, how were they conducted? Well, they were done with a combination of direct observation, where I watched, recorded and took notes during each playthrough, and post-play surveys, where testers had the opportunity to provide their own feedback and potential advice on how to improve.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/GooD/IMG_2799_scrubbed.png" alt="Direct Test." width="720px">

            </figure>
            <p>Yes, early on in the playtesting, I did just record people playing my level as I stood behind them.</p>
            <p>Later on, I would just resort to jotting down notes on my phone, detailing a play-by-play account of the recorded testers playthrough. A mirror of these notes can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CF16QU4tjwjzVKLeHsLd7JrpjGQQzsGB5nBqiDZexvg/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
            <p>These playtests did help to reveal a lot of issues, mainly the flatness of the route at that point in development, the potentially confusing layout causing testers to get lost, lack of checkpoints, no clear direction as to where to go from the start, lack of available weapon and ammo pickups, etc.</p>
            <p>If you wish to view the responses that I have recieved via the post-play surveys, you can do so <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YBPYiPR5o6gUDloAL9MBrwV5MWZrKhOifesX-H2xg70/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m9VIQKXXxbfJWfzwM6RDr5__dzSJ3KRRH4eCZ7Wj51A/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
            <p>What I love about these respones, especially from the second survey is that it more or less confirms that the response that I had made to the initial round of feedback was the right response, this sentiment is also had when looking at the tester notes, more specifically the last three testers, all of which made it to the end of the level, only got lost for very brief periods, died only once, etc.</p>
            <p>This all showed that I was on the right track, and got me motivated to continue after a period of minor burnout from working on this level for so long.</p>
            <aside style="padding: 5px; background: rgb(177,119,42); background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%);">
              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">DIRECTOR'S CUT</p>
            </aside>
            <p>Another element of this Level that I am very proud of is the set of cinematics that I have made for it, the Start, Middle and End of the level feature a cinematic that provides a break from the action and to both provide context as to the world the Player is in and to act as a guide to where the Player should go with a combination of camera moves and audio dialogue.</p>
            <p>The cinematic that I am the most proud of is the cinematic that plays if the Player fails to make it to the boat in time, when I posted it to the work in progress discord channel, the response was overwhelmingly positive, making note of its ability to convey emotion with no dialogue, only the movements of the Player character.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>These cinematics were also the most complex element to implement into the level, with various issues encountered such as certain actors despawning due to the world partiton, me not checking where I was making my edits resulting in progress having to be restarted at certain points, the Player Character actor triggering sequences within sequences, etc, but in the end, they all work as expected and I couldn't be happier.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>In the eleventh hour of the level's development, I decided to attempt to include more worldbuilding elements in the form of notes that can be found and read throughout the intended route of the level.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/GooD/StartNote.png" alt="Note." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot showing a note near the start of the level.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These notes offer a more easily digested form of worldbuilding as it allows for the Player to read more about the setting without having to leave the level.</p>
            <p>Within these notes, I've tried to give context to multiple elements such as why there's no real friendly faces throughout the town, why the stores are mostly empty, etc.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/GooD/StartNoteUi.png" alt="Note." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot showing the content of the first note.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I also thought up of other town names than the one that the Player has found themself in, this makes the world feel much bigger that there is, that there are towns like the one you're in, most likely experiencing the same hell as you.</p>
