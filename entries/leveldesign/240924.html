            </aside>
            <p>This is the first entry in a series focused of my journey in learning level design using the Unreal Engine. To give some background, I do have <em>some</em> base level experience with Level Design, growing up using the Source Engine, I could bang out some box maps with some hastely applied textures and call it a day.</p>
            <p>Sometimes though, I would sit down and dedicate some time to learn more about the Source Engine's level editor, Hammer, and actually make a competent map, especially if it was for a competition/map jam with a relatively short deadline.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>But I recognise that the old, brush-based, and arguably more simple workflow for Level Design is now long in the past as far as the industry is concerned, we're now long past the days of Hideo Kojima constructing Shadow Moses Island out of LEGO pieces, and some young lad with the family computer being able throw out a small yet playable Deathmatch map for DOOM or Quake.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, we have newer, mesh-based and more complex Level Design tools for newer and more complex engines such as Unreal Engine 5, not to say that you <eM>can't</eM> make the old ways work with the new, but I highly doubt that what I will be asked to do going forward. <em>[Insert Laugh Track]</em></p>
            <p>That's why I'm here now, about to learn and dive head first into the modern world and properly learn all of the ins and outs of what makes a good level, the General Dos and Don'ts and how to critically analyse other levels from other games, what makes them good and/or memorable, and how to take that analysis and apply it to my own levels.</p>
