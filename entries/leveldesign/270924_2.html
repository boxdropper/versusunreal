            </div>
            <p>For this entry, I will be conducting an Analysis from a Level/Chapter of a Video Game. In this case, I will be analysing the famous "No Mercy" campaign of the original Left 4 Dead (2008).</p>
            <p>This analysis will primarily cover the following techniques used by Valve and Turtle Rock Studios when designing the campaign which are but not limited to:</p>
            <li>Leading Lines/Guiding the Player</li>
            <li>The Usage of Verticality to show progression</li>
            <li>Usage of Enemy Spawn Locations by the Game Director System</li>
            <li>Using Items and Enemies to facilitate Flow</li>
            <li>The Usage of Hordes to indicate progress and assist with pacing</li>
            <li>Various Worldbuilding Elements</li>
            <p>and so on, so forth. Let's get started!</p>
            <aside style="padding: 5px; background: rgb(177,119,42); background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%);">
              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">DOWN AND UP AGAIN</p>
            </aside>
            <p>The usage of verticality in Level Design is a good way to diegetically tell the Player that they're making progress through a level, climbing up a long ladder, going up a large flight of stairs, heading up an elevator, etc.</p>
            <p>What makes this technique special is how the Level Designer can make this progress feel more impactful/encouraging, for example, in the Elevator, the designer can have one end of it be a large window, showing how the Player is ascending up whatever structure they're in, or when they're already at the top, having the Player see the streets below that they may have once traversed earlier on.</p>
            <p>This works doubly so if whatever's at the top is the objective, like in No Mercy, where the objective is to reach the top of Mercy Hospital.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/MercyRoofOBJ.png" alt="It's like a whiteboard." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot showing the Mercy Hospital building, this is your objective.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The way that verticality is used in the No Mercy campaign is also very encouraging in my experience, to start with, you don't start No Mercy at the bottom, instead you start somewhere in the middle, on top of another building of which you'll make your way down.</p>
            <p>All the way down into the sewers, the lowest point in the campaign.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/GoingDown.png" alt="Woah." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Collage of screenshots showing us going from a rooftop, down to street level then the sewers and back up.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This kind of progression shows that the progression quality of vertically can also work in reverse, instead of the player going up, they go down and in fact, No Mercy does both, here's where the encouragement comes in, as your reward from coming out of the sewers is...</p>
            <p>The Entrance to Mercy Hospital!</p>

            </aside>
            <p>"Leading Lines" are a common practice in Level Design and are used to guide the Player in a particular direction, these lines are given to the Player in a variety of ways, mainly depending on the style that Game Designers and/or Environment Artists are aiming for.</p>
            <p>The usage of Power Lines as leading lines is a very common practice in Town and City environments and No Mercy is...No Different <em>[Insert Laugh Track]</em></p>
            <p>When you first get down to street level, you can see a set of power lines leading you down the street.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/LeadingLines_1.png" alt="Da Lines." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot of street level, looking at the power lines.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Following these power lines, round the corner, we're greeted with more power lines but on a knocked down pole, angling the power lines downward, the pole itself almost seeming like its own leading line.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/LeadingLines_2.png" alt="Da Lines." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot of street level, looking at knocked down power line pole.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>And what do we see when we follow these lines?</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240927184053_1.png" alt="Da Lines." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot of street level, looking at knocked down power line pole and the subway entrance.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The Entrance to the Subway, big orange light in there, can't miss it.</p>
            <p>That mention of the light leads into another point of mine, how No Mercy uses light sources to guide the Player, if the Player follows the light, they'll get to where they need to go.</p>
            <p>There are more examples of this "Follow the Light" approach throughout the Subway, Sewer and Hospital sections of No Mercy, starting in the Subway, while traversing down, the Player eventually comes to a fork in the road.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240927184305_1.png" alt="Da Lights." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot of the Subway, showing a fork in the road...and Francis ruining the shot, thanks man, real cool.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>If the Player was to follow the Light, in this case, on the right, they'll be going the right way. Later on in the Subway, the Player finds themselves in another dark area. But if they follow the light, they'll quickly be out of there and on their way!</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240927184331_1.png" alt="Da Lights." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot of a dark basement near the Subway.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Sewer sections in Video Games are often derided as being more maze like than standard levels that can prove frustrating on repeat playthroughs, No Mercy avoids this by again, applying the Follow The Light technique. (While also combining it with the Leading Power Lines to give a reason as to why there would be lights in a sewer)</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240927184902_1.png" alt="Da Lights." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot of inside the Sewer showing the Light and Power Line.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>You may be wondering why I'm talking about lights a fair bit in an analysis about Level Design, lights are more of an Environment Design thing right?</p>
            <p>Well, back then, in the days of the Source Engine, it was common for the Level Design and the Environment Design to be much more homogeneous than they are in the modern day, a Level Designer would blockout, then texture, light and detail all in one go, instead of just doing a blockout and waiting for a separate Environment Artist to do all the rest.</p>
            <p>Yes, assets such as Props, Vehicles and the like would have to be done by other artists, but it would all end with the Level Designer, the one who did the planning, blockouts, flash testing, etc.</p>
            <p>The lighting matters just as much to the Level Designers of old as the Environment Artists of today.</p>
            <p>But back onto the topic of Leading Lines, they don't always have to be so overt like the Power Lines that I have shown you previously, in some cases, they can be invisible, essentially baked into the level geometry itself.</p>
            <p>An example being right before you set foot on the rooftop of Mercy Hospital, where you can see the inside of an Elevator shaft.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240927185806_1.png" alt="Da Shaft." width="720px">

            </figure>
            <p>You'll need to get to that ladder to progress, but how? Trying to jump would just be suicide. But, following the curve of the floor below the ladder leads to...</p>

            </aside>
            <p>Keeping the Player motivated is a must in Video Games and this can be accomplished in various ways, in No Mercy, the Level Designer made it a point to try and have Mercy Hospital be visible at various points throughout the campaign, turning it into a landmark, similar to the usage of the Citadel in Valve's previous game, Half-Life 2.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/MercyHospital.png" alt="Da Hospital." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Collage of screenshots showing the Player at closer and closer distances to Mercy Hospital.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The closer the Player gets to Mercy Hospital, the more motivated they get.</p>
            <aside style="padding: 5px; background: rgb(177,119,42); background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%);">
              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">TEMPTED WITH THE PROMISE OF MEDICINE</p>
            </aside>
            <p>Another way of keeping the Player motivated and driving them forward is with the careful placement of Items/Weapons throughout a level, without either this, the previous landmark technique or any other form of Player motivation, then the Player has no reason to leave their current position, and the Level has no Flow.</p>
            <p>Throughout No Mercy and all other campaigns in Left 4 Dead, outside of escaping the location you're currently in, what drives the Player forward is the promise of more weapons, ammo, health items, etc. This can be seen in No Mercy with the table of ammo alongside 3 of the strongest weapons in the game.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240928111137_1.png" alt="Da Weapons." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshots showing an ammo and weapon cache.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This gives the Player opportunity to either quickly replinish any lost ammo and/or grab any new weapons that they want to try, but this isn't the only way that No Mercy rewards the Player for pressing on.</p>
            <p>In various points throughout No Mercy, there are multiple opportunities for the Player to take a slight detour off the intended path, taking these detours are often rewarded with either more zombies to kill, a throwable, a healing item, or a combination of all three.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240928111657_1.png" alt="Da Detour." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshots showing the common reward for taking detours.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>But I'd be remiss talking about motivating factors in a Left 4 Dead campaign if I didn't talk about the biggest form of motivation...The Safehouses.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240928110903_1.png" alt="Da Safehouse." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshots showing the graffiti used to signify a safehouse.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The Safehouses are the proverbial carrot on a stick that keeps the Player moving to the final chapter, every time they see one, it is a rush of relief and direct confirmation that progress is being made as they act as chapter dividers within every Left 4 Dead campaign.</p>
            <p>And inside those chapter dividers comes an ammo cache, weapons and a case of healing items for the Player to stock up, heal up, swap weapons if they feel like it, etc.</p>
            <aside style="padding: 5px; background: rgb(177,119,42); background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%);">

            </aside>
            <p>The Horde mechanic seen in the Left 4 Dead series has ties to the design of the Levels/Campaigns, in either the middle or near end of a chapter, the Player is faced with an obstacle such as a locked shutter door, or a generator powered mechanism, anything that produces a loud enough sound to attract a full on assault of infected.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240927184356_1.png" alt="Da Horde." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot showing the UI Element warning of the Horde that will come as a result of interacting with the outlined object.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These Hordes act as a quick change of pace during campaigns as prior to these encounters, the Player is more or less moving at <em>their own</em> pace, while there may be points where there'll be a larger group of infected than most but there's nothing that really shakes things up, spikes adrenaline, etc.</p>
            <p>The Horde encounters are that change in pace that the campaigns need, when activating one, all other priorities go out the airlock, all that matters now is to keep moving, clear out and maneuver around infected as fast as possible, do not stop, if you stop, you're dead as infected are flooding in from every window, rooftop and crevice to swarm you.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240928111801_1.png" alt="Da Horde." width="720px">
              <figcaption>Screenshot showing the Horde coming down from the rooftops!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>These Hordes also act as great indicators of progress as where there is a horde, a safehouse is not far ahead.</p>
            <p>With this and the chapter structure of the No Mercy campaign allows for a quick visuallisation of a "beat chart" of a chapter, starting low and steadily climbing, spiking during a horde and coming right back down when at a safehouse.</p>
            <figure>

              <figcaption>Screenshot a quick beat chart for a typical No Mercy chapter.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>But this isn't a static beat for each chapter, Left 4 Dead's Game Director system ensures that no two playthroughs are alike, so this beat chart can have changes in both spikes and dips.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>Speaking of the Game Director System, what is it exactly?</p>
            <p>The Game Director acts as a digital "gamemaster" for those familliar with table-top RPGs, an arbitrator that determins where weapons, items and even both amount of and type of infected that spawn.</p>
            <p>With this Director, no two playthroughs of a Campaign are alike, there will always be a variable number of common and special infected, weapons and items. One playthorugh may be a breeze and the other chucks multiple special infected your way because the Director determined that you were having too much fun.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="../../images/screenies/l4d/500_20240928111137_1.png" alt="Da Director." width="720px">
              <figcaption>This table of weapons may be empty on your next playthrough!</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The randomized infected spawns also means that the Player and co. will most likely have to slightly shift how they approach certian parts of a Campaign, either speeding through areas or having to slow down and clear the way when there are lots of nearby infected, the Director having to balance these encounters around the Player's current performance, position, loadout, etc.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>Left 4 Dead is famous for having an ensemble cast of characters, a 4-team squad of colourful characters from all walks of life, all brought together as demanded by the situation around them.</p>

            <p>While you can only play as one at a time, that doesn't mean that the characters that you didn't pick for the moment don't have anything beyond acting as an additional gun for the Player, they have personalities and are voiced.</p>
            <p>Sometimes these voice lines are relevant to the campaign that you're currently playing, mostly related to either the location you're currently in, or locations that can be seen nearby, if either your character or a companion points out a location in the world, you're heading in the right direction.</p>
            <p>These voice lines can point out key buildings, nearby special infected, offer worldbuilding, etc.</p>

            <p>In Left 4 Dead, you're never really shown how the infection all started, you're thrust into the middle of it, after nearly everyone else has either escaped, died, got infected, or a combination of the three.</p>

            <p>Other groups definitely came before yours but weren't as lucky or as efficient as you, suffering losses as those losses were left behind, the rest of the group just hoping that their dead wouldn't eventually turn.</p>
            <p>Another example of previous people walking the same paths you took are the various pieces of wall graffiti, primarily seen within the safehouses.</p>
