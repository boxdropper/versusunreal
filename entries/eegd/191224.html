            </div>
            <p>In this entry, I'll be documenting my role and contributions for the Extended and Experimental Game Design project titled: "Annual Garbage Throwing Competition", a Virtual Reality title centered around throwing bags of garbage.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>The project begun with a brainstorming session done via Miro, where myself and my two other team members rapid fired ideas for Mobile, VR and AR projects that we could work on and assembled them onto a table, one member having assigned themselves a column to fill with myself having the VR column.</p>

            <p>After which, we decided to do a VR game and begun to expand on a few ideas with suggestions/ideas as to how they'll play.</p>

            <p>As seen in this screenshot, we had the choice of three VR games that could become our first VR project, ultimately deciding to pursue the Garbage Throwing game idea, with our team's designated Level Designer drafting up ideas for the level, while myself and the other remaining team member begun work on the pitch presentation.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>While making the pitch presentation our team had assigned ourselves the roles with myself taking on the role of programming/scripting, meaning that I would have the opportunity to go fully hands-on with VR development within the Unreal Engine and carry the burden of lugging around a big box of expensive equipment to home and back to campus.</p>
            <p>Working on the pitch presentation allowed for me to come up with both the core and pillars of the project and have an idea of how the key mechanics can/should work, such as the Player having to shake garbage bags in order to determine what type of garbage is inside in order to throw it into the correct garbage bin.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>With the pitch out of the way, I set about bringing the VR headset home and setting up a GitHub repository for all three of us to work on the project at home and also on campus to ensure we all have an up-to-date version.</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Screenshot of the project's GitHub repository.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I also went about creating a private Discord Server for the team so that we can talk outside of campus and also have a live feed to the GitHub repository so we know if any changes have been made that we'd need to pull.</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>With all of that out of the way, I grabbed my laptop and begun setting up the development environment that I would be in for the next couple of weeks.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/screenies/EEGD/setup.png" alt="Da Setup." width="720px">

            </figure>
            <p>With this setup, I loaded up the VR Template project that comes with the Unreal Engine, had a bit of fun with it and then had a look in the content to see how various elements worked and begun to incorporate it into the "Annual Garbage Throwing Competition", creating a test map to rapid prototype and implement the mechanics which included the bag shaking, randomized garbage and multiple garbage bin types, etc.</p>
            <p>By far the hardest mechanic to implement was the bag shaking as there is no easy way for the bags to detect that they were being shaken, largely due to grabbed objects in VR having no real velocity, so I had to find a workaround and I found it in the form of keeping a vector variable of where the bag was grabbed and detecting whether it was moved even slightly from that vector, which would typically indicate that it was being shaken.</p>
            <p>This method was so hacky I shoved most of it into a collapsed node so that I wouldn't have to look at it for any longer than I needed, I would later use these collapsed nodes to clean up other areas of code as well.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>But with that, the bag works about as is expected, getting damaged while being shaken, eventually despawning.</p>

            <p>This talk about the trials and tribulations about getting the bag shaking mechanic to work brings me to another issue with VR development in the Unreal Engine.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>Throwing in VR sucks.</p>
            <p>Since Unreal doesn't track the velocity of grabbed actors, it leads to an issue where Players attempt to throw the bag, only to have it fall straight down without any forward momentum.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/screenies/EEGD/gifs/BagThrowFail.gif" alt="Da Bag." width="720px">

            </figure>
            <p>Very fun, no problems whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But later on in development, I decided to try and make the Player de-prioritize using over-arm throws as those are the most likely to encounter this issue, Players who opt for more realistic under-arm throws or "push throwing" have a much easier time with the bags.</p>
            <aside style="padding: 5px; background: rgb(177,119,42); background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%);">

            </aside>
            <p>With that out of my system, back to the rest of development, where after implementing bag shaking, came time to implement the different garbage types and different garbage bins which was surprisingly simple, making usage of two enumerator blueprints, one for the bag, one for the bins and checking if the current "byte" of the two are matching when the Player throws a bag into a bin, if so, they're awarded 10 points, if the throw it into the wrong bin, just 1 point.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>One thing that I have neglected to mention up until now is that after the team gave the pitch presentation, the lecturers gave us some suggestions as to how we can make this project better by adding more than the currently existing mechanics, these suggestions included auditory distractions to make things more challenging and a way to get rid of said distractions.</p>
            <p>With that suggestion, I came up with the idea of the Player having to fire a blank, starter pistol to scare away nearby cardboard cutouts of dogs.</p>
            <p>I also implemented a metal detector actor that the Player can use to detect metal garbage bags, they emit a sound and also trigger vibrations on the Player's controller if it detects metal.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>With a majority of the work done on mechanics, I decided to scout for assets to use for the project to replace the test objects and primitives that I have been using up until this point, and some quick searching on Sketchfab yielded results, I was able to find assets for the <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/stylized-trash-garbage-bags-low-poly-6a554baa60574b1eb524709a06224be1">Garbage Bag</a>, <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/green-recycle-waste-bin-120l-rigged-low-poly-60116f426a8448a3bf3a3e9091bc2a7b">Garbage Bins</a>, <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/handheld-metal-detector-247209543f2f4b5b9900e938c117162b">Metal Detector</a> and <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/minx-toy-pistol-model-low-poly-65b14c3daaee4657b8219669f33aebc6">Starter Pistol</a>.</p>
            <p>So with a new hole burned in my wallet, I begun the process of implementing the assets into the project.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/screenies/EEGD/OldAssets.png" alt="Da Assets." width="720px">
                <figcaption>Screenshot showing all of the fresly bought assets in the test level.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Now not all of these assets were a simple drop in replacement for the old test assets, some such as the bags, bins and starter pistol required some modification both before and after implementation into the Engine.</p>
            <p>For the bags, since the asset came in a bag of different looking bags, I decided to include them all and re-use the code for selecting a random garbage type to select a random garbage bag look.</p>
            <p>The Starter Pistol required the texture to be modified to actually look like a starter pistol which was done in Blender, using the texture paint tool.</p>
            <p>And lastly for the bins, the model only came in one colour, and I wanted four to signify the four, later five different garbage types, so that requires modification to the texture to make it greyscale, so that I can modify it via material instances within the Unreal Engine.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/screenies/EEGD/Nodes/BinMatNode.png" alt="Da Material." width="720px">
                <figcaption>Screenshot showing part of the Material Node Graph for the Garbage Bin's material.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This "binTint" parameter would be use to create material instances for each of the garbage types, simply by changing the colour value within this parameter, and then using the code of the bin actors to select the colour alongside the garbage type.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/screenies/EEGD/Nodes/BinMatVar.png" alt="Da Material." width="720px">

                <figcaption>Screenshot of the Bin actor's node graph showing how the garbage type determines the colour/material that the Bin inherits.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>To go even further, I wanted to give the bins a little animation for whenever a bag makes it inside, to give a little bit of visual feedback for the Player and so I got to work.</p>
            <p>I opted to use Unreal Engine's own animation tools to do this so that I could stay within the Unreal Editor and as an excuse to try features of the Editor that I hadn't already tried yet.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Alongside creating an animation for the bin, I also went about sourcing sound effects for the Bag, Bin, Metal Detector, Starter Pistol, etc.</p>
            <p>Luckily I had the perfect source in the form of <a href="https://freesound.org/">freesound.org</a>, where a majority of the sounds come from.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>With the bin animations done and sound effects sourced, my end of the bargain was more or less complete at that point and it just came done to testing and potential refinement of my implemented mechanics while waiting for the other two members of the team to get their work for both the Levels and UI done.</p>
            <p>Eventually there came a point where we started getting our work together within the GitHub Repository and I was able to test and tinker with the others' work.</p>
            <p>One immediate problem that I had noticed was that a lot of the environment was far to large for Seated VR Players, which is the VR Playstyle that I have been using for testing and the one that we had agreed would be the preferred way to play, so I had to quickly scale all of that down and then found time to properly test and implement any mechanics that were missing within the levels.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/screenies/EEGD/OldMap1.png" alt="Da Map." width="720px">
                <figcaption>Screenshot showing the main map with mechanics implemented both by myself and the level designer.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>One of these mechanics that I have implemented into this map which you can't quite see here is the distraction, how does it work, how does it spawn, well it has to do with that Target Point seen behind the Player Start Point.</p>
            <p>I created an actor which spawns the distraction at the target point every 45 seconds from the start of the level, using an editable array variable to set the spawn point(s)</p>

            </figure>
            <p>This setup is scalable as I can place multiple target points around the level and the distraction will spawn at all of them, which will be useful way later.</p>
            <p>And if you're wondering about the conveyor belts, I didn't make 'em, so they aint getting any further mention here.</p>

            <p>With the levels implemented and the mechanics refined as much a I could withing the time frame, it came time to round up all of our work and record a gameplay video, which I did, at home, late at night, taking multiple attempts to provide a proper look at the gameplay and our collective progress.</p>

            <p>With this gameplay video recorded and presented to lecturers, we got our first round of feedback, while the overall opinion of the game was positive, there were a few areas where they believed that the game could be improved, such as bringing elements of the main level closer together to prevent the player from moving around so much and to consider implementing other forms of movement, feedback of which, we would act on soon enough.</p>

            <p>"Annual Garbage Throwing Competition DX", a name that I quickly came up with as a joke/reference towards the 2003 GameCube port of the 1999 Dreamcast game, "Sonic Adventure", titled "Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut", is an expanded and enhanced version of the original "Annual Garbage Throwing Competition", featuring overhauled visuals, improved controls, accessibility features, etc.</p>
            <p>The first bit of new content added to this new version was an option for a "Colour-Blind Awareness" mode that changes various object colours to make the bin colours more distinct and also adds better visual cues in the form of additional icons on each bin to make them all more visually distinct for colour blind players.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>My first attempt at implementing a colour-blind mode into the project made use of a <a href="https://elias-wick.com/portfolio/shaders/material-functions/color-blindness">material function pack created by Elias Wick</a>, which used Post-Process volumes to simulate the three main types of colour blindness, Deuteranopia, Protanopia & Tritanopia.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>This worked but there was a problem, this is just a <em>simulation</em> of colour blindness, not something that would actually assist Colour Blind Players.</p>
            <p>For an actual colour-blind mode, colours have to be changed so that they can be distinct enough for a Colour Blind Player to tell them apart, but what is the problem with the current bin colours?</p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Screenshot showing the current bin colours.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Well if we were to take this image and lower the saturation by about 90%...</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../../images/screenies/EEGD/OldBinColsCB.png" alt="Da Bins." width="720px">

            </figure>
            <p>While you can still make out some if not all of the current colours, someone who is colour blind will have a much harder time. So not only will I have to change the bin colours to ones that can be more easily differentiated when colour blind, using the method of desaturating an image by 90% to test, but to also add more visual indicators for the bins, to be more specific, a large icon below the label which tells the player what type of garbage it takes, which you can already see, I have added, it uses the same enum as the garbage type to determine what icon is shown in-game.</p>

            <p>Nice, now comes the other major addition that I have made to the project, the ability for the Player to traverse via Twin-Stick controls rather than teleportation.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>To add Twin-Stick controls, I followed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GKBXl7Jul4">video tutorial by "Werewolven"</a> with a minor modification as I wanted to allow for the Player to choose between Teleportation and Twin-Stick movement.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Later on, I would make a custom Game Instance Blueprint that saved this setting so that Player's wouldn't have to keep going into the settings to change their traversal method.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the other team members were busy giving a visual overhaul to the two main levels that the Player will be in, <a href="https://www.fab.com/listings/ffbb6cb7-0ca1-4fc2-bed8-ea9935f65030">finding and purchasing an asset pack from the Unreal Marketplace/Fab</a> and going to town with them, gone were the grey and blue boxes of the original levels.</p>

            <p>You may notice the Garbage Bins are now replaced with larger containers, this was a decision made by the other team members and lecturers as a way to make the gameplay more easy as trying to throw in a VR game where throwing sucks, into a small garbage bin target is, suprise suprise, not very fun.</p>
            <p>Luckily elements such as the colour blind code was easy to port over to these new bins, even though at that point I was still pretty committed to the smaller bins, but later on I would grow to appreciate the large containers.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>While working on the visual overhaul, we decided that we wanted to showcase the project at "PlayMyDemo", a showcase event where game developers across Northern Ireland showcase their games to others, network with other developers, build friendships, maybe relationships, I don't know but that's irrelevant, what matters is that myself and the others in my team went into "all hands on deck" mode to get this project presentable for PlayMyDemo.</p>
            <p>But in the scramble, there rose an ugly issue that can be traced back to the visual overhaul where, if the Player was to use Teleport locomotion, they'll find themselves with a one way trip to the dimension below the world where no-one can hear them scream.</p>
