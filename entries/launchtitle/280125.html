            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">For a while now, I've had this...fascination with old, long dead online games, it ties in to my love of the "old internet" in general. In the current age of social media algorithms finding new and exciting ways to bruise my soul, it's at the very least comforting to be able to see what people on the internet used to use to make conversation, whether it'll be IRC, web forums and in this case, "massively multiplayer online" games (MMOs).</p>
            <figure class="figure">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">But as mentioned above, there's been a lesser need for these types of games to exist for the purpose of meeting people online and as such, most drift off into obscurity and obsolescence, forever buried under aging code that's at risk of becoming incompatible with each OS update or worse, the Master Servers themselves being permanently taken offline so that their corporate paymasters can use the resources to fund the payments of their 5th yacht, only a few that have managed to keep up with the rapidly changing online world still remain today, but their best days are long behind them.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">Gets even more tragic when I bring up the amount of MMOs that were made for children, set up as dedicated safe spaces for them online, nowadays being either long dead as well or shells of their former selves, leaving children with no real online safe spaces anymore, they have to go to Twitter now, a horrifying reality.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">So when the new semester came around and I got the opportunity to share this fascination and how it can be turned into an interesting, narrative driven game with a group of fellow game design students, I was excited.</p>
            <div class="row p-4 pb-0 pe-lg-0 pt-lg-2 align-items-center rounded-3 shadow" style="background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%)">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">Within my team of game designers, I have elected to give myself the role of scripting, due to my work for the previous "Extended & Experimental Game Design" module also because I believed that being the one that would understand how the game would be made/prototyped, should give me a way to give the game an appropriate scope. But the team didn't just consist of game design students like myself, we were also joined by three animation students so there's also the need to make sure the intended content of the game does not overtake their skill level.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">As the majority of our animation members feel as if they have better experience with 2D animation, the decision to try and lean into create a "2.5D" Game as created a full, complete, 2D game in the Unreal Engine is no easy task, but I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
            <div class="row p-4 pb-0 pe-lg-0 pt-lg-2 align-items-center rounded-3 shadow" style="background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%)">
              <h3 class="text-start text-light fs-1" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000;">WILL IT BLEND?</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">My idea of a game set in an abandoned or soon to be abandoned online game was only one of many ideas that I and the other game designers on our team had come up with and slammed into a Miro Board with sticky notes.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">The idea was to pick a few ideas from the list, find commonalities between them and see how those commonalities would work when compiled together into a single game. The primary inspirations for our ideas came from emotions and the types that we wish for the Player to express during play, metaphors for mental/emotional issues, various robot/AI stories, etc.</p>
            <figure class="figure">

              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Screenshot showing the list of ideas on the Miro Board.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">The three sticky notes coloured green are the three ideas that we, as a whole team picked out and begun to find pieces in common to form a whole.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">With the help of the lecturers, we were able to narrow down what the game will be like, a narrative-driven game where you play as a NPC in an unpopular online game that is expected to shutdown soon, before the shutdown, you find and converse with other NPCs, growing closer with them and finding comfort in the face of the end, while also keeping your end of game up and running.</p>

            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">While the rest of the team continued with idea refinement for the then upcoming presentation, I kept a close eye on how those ideas were being developed as, being a scripter, I had to worry about the actual implementation of our ideas into the Unreal Engine, so I also did some research by watching a few tutorials on YouTube about dialogue systems, working with 2D sprites using a plugin named "PaperZD", etc.</p>
            <div class="row p-4 pb-0 pe-lg-0 pt-lg-2 align-items-center rounded-3 shadow" style="background: linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(177,119,42,1) 0%, rgba(218,176,2,1) 100%)">
              <h3 class="text-start text-light fs-1" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000;">WELL SPOKEN</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">To begin the project in Unreal, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcwVLBaUNnHp363AcMujYllSAmhJ2XMwK">I started by following this tutorial series by Michael Pattison which showcases how to make an in-depth dialogue system.</a> Although, I had make some changes to what was done in the tutorial for a few reasons.</p>
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="../../images/screenies/lt/TestConvo1.png" alt="Da Dialogue." width="720px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Screenshot showing the dialogue system in action.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">The first change was the design of the UI for the dialogue system, making it more of a horizontal design, similar to that of visual novels. This was done as looking at the UI concepts/"scamps" that other members of the team created, a majority of them have the dialogue box placed at the bottom of the screen with a horizontal design.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">The second change, or more appropriate, addition was made to the dialogue system came later, since the system that was featured in the tutorial was surprisingly easy to understand, it was easy to make additions to the code, in this case, adding in an image that can correspond to the actor currently speaking.</p>
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="../../images/screenies/lt/TestConvo2.png" alt="Da Dialogue." width="720px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Screenshot showing the added speaker image.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">This system also works on a per-dialogue basis, meaning that this image can change between pieces of dialogue, allowing for characters to change expressions on the fly without having to start a whole new conversation.</p>
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="../../images/screenies/lt/nodes/dialogueCreateSpeakerImage.png" alt="Da Nodes." width="720px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Screenshot showing the function for adding dialogue to the UI, showing the option to select the speaker's image, the node also features options for sound effects and animations.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">To go further into the features of this dialogue system, there is also the feature of dialogue "branches".</p>
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="../../images/screenies/lt/nodes/branchSwitch.png" alt="Da Branches." width="720px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Screenshot showing the code that changes the dialogue branch using a "Switch on Name" node.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">This allows for the system to easily change branches of dialogue between conversations, meaning that all of an actors dialogue can be within one component instead of multiple for each intended branch. To further this example, say an Actor has their default branch be a simple greeting to the Player, the Player then selects an option to continue the default branch's dialogue and when the Player eventually ends the conversation then returns to the Actor, the Actor now has a completely different branch of dialogue.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">These branch switches can either be triggered within the dialogue event after the Player selects a dialogue option or via external triggers by casting to the actor's dialogue component.</p>
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="../../images/screenies/lt/ConvoBranchSwitching.gif" alt="Da Dialogue." width="720px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Animated image showing a single dialogue component with multiple branches, that are switched based on the option that the Player selects.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">Speaking of triggers, the dialogue system is also capable of triggering events within the component, to create an example, I had the Actor change their Skeletal Mesh when the Player selects a specific option.</p>

              <h3 class="text-start text-light fs-1" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000;">A FLAT SOUND</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">I knew from the presentation (and from what you may have read above) that the game would consist of animated 2D characters so I set about learning a key plugin for the Unreal Engine that would help facilitate that, PaperZD.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">PaperZD is a plugin that greatly expands the capabilities of Unreal's existing 2D toolset, for example, allowing for the creation of sprite actors with animation blueprints, similar to regular skeletal meshes, a feature that I would make use of to create dummy/test sprites for now, until the animation team get some proper character sprites done.</p>
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="../../images/screenies/lt/dummySprites.gif" alt="Da Sprites." width="720px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Animated screenshot showing the dummy sprites in Editor.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">The Dialogue system can then be modified to play a specified animation for whenever the characters are talking, which should add some extra life to them when inside the game world.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">With that, I decided that it was time to create a video for the other members of the Game Design team documenting how to use the system themselves.</p>
            <figure class="figure">

              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Self-made Video documenting the Dialogue System.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">Speaking of animations, I would need to give at least a tentative list of animations that the animation team would have to create for all the characters that will be featured, including some ones unique to the Player Character to make them stand out.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">Back to the Miro Board, I and the other members of the Game Design team went to work on a rough game design document, my contributions to it being detailing mechanics such as the dialogue system and character animations.</p>
            <figure class="figure">
              <img src="../../images/screenies/lt/miro_gdd1.png" alt="Da GDD." width="720px">
              <figcaption class="figure-caption text-light fst-italic">Screenshot showing my excerpt from the rough GDD.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">It was around this same time that we'd made contact with our team member from the Sound Design course, and we decided to conduct a meeting with them, seeing as they're both at completely different campus and they had no idea how much work that us on both the Game Design and Animation side had done yet.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">The meeting was conducted over Discord and largely consisted of coming to an agreement/general idea as to what sound effects would be required, what style the sound effects should be (Realistic or Stylized/Cartoony), what materials could be used to generate sound effects (e.g: What surfaces will the Player be expected to walk on?), any music and the intended mood/feeling of said music.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">Following this meeting, I and other Game Design members got to work on composing a list of sound effects for the designer to create.</p>
            <figure class="figure">

            </figure>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">With a sound list done, I decided to go back to the project to implement another mechanic which you've seen on the screenshot of the GDD, the "Party" system.</p>

              <h3 class="text-start text-light fs-1" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000;">PARTY OF PAIN</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">The Party System was both a pain and somehow also not that hard to implement, mainly because I had seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMOganG-YqU">this tutorial by Josh Clark</a> and figured that I can use parts of it to make a system where the Player can interact with an NPC, ask the NPC to follow them and later telling them to go back to where they were initially.</p>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">When you get down to it, a potential party member consists of these components.</p>
            <li class="text-light text-start fs-5">A Character Actor for the idle/non-party NPC.</li>
            <li class="text-light text-start fs-5">A separate Character Class for the version of the NPC that is in the Player's Party.</li>
            <li class="text-light text-start fs-5">A Struct that contains variables that drive various aspects of the Party Member, including their name, sprite and animation blueprint.</li>
            <li class="text-light text-start fs-5">A Pawn Blueprint that acts as a spawner for the Party Version of the NPC, which works via communication with the Level Blueprint.</li>
            <li class="text-light text-start fs-5">A Blueprint Interface that acts as a way for other blueprints to communicate with the Level Blueprint using a Name Input, similar to the Dialogue System and its branches.</li>
            <li class="text-light text-start fs-5">An AI Controller that makes the AI follow the Player by going to their current location with a distance buffer so that they don't clip into the Player.</li>
            <br>
            <p class="text-light text-start fs-5">With all of that, we now have an NPC that can follow the Player on request, and also return to their original position on request.</p>
