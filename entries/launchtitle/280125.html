            </p>
            <p>For a while now, I've had this...fascination with old, long dead online games, it ties in to my love of the "old internet" in general. In the current age of social media algorithms finding new and exciting ways to bruise my soul, it's at the very least comforting to be able to see what people on the internet used to use to make conversation, whether it'll be IRC, web forums and in this case, "massively multiplayer online" games (MMOs).</p>

            </aside>
            <p>But as mentioned above, there's been a lesser need for these types of games to exist for the purpose of meeting people online and as such, most drift off into obscruity and obsolescence, forever buried under aging code that's at risk of becoming incompatible with each OS update or worse, the Master Servers themselves being permanently taken offline so that their corporate paymasters can use the resources to fund the payments their 5th yacht, only a few that have managed to keep up with the rapidly changing online world still remain today, but their best days are long behind them.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Gets even more tragic when I bring up the amount of MMOs that were made for children, set up as dedicated safe spaces for them online, nowadays being either long dead as well or shells of their former selves, leaving children with no real online safe spaces anymore, they have to go to Twitter now, a horrifying reality.</p>
            <p>So when the new semester came around and I got the opportunity to share this fascination and how it can be turned into an interesting, narrative driven game with a group of fellow game design students, I was excited.</p>

            </aside>
            <p>Within my team of game designers, I have elected to give myself the role of scripting, due to my work for the previous "Extended & Experimental Game Design" module also becuase I believed that being the one that would understand how the game would be made/prototyped, should give me a way to give the game an appropriate scope. But the team didn't just consist of game design students like myself, we were also joined by three animation students so there's also the need to make sure the intended content of the game does not overtake their skill level.</p>
            <p>As the majority of our animation members feel as if they have better experience with 2D animation, the decision to try and lean into create a "2.5D" Game as created a full, complete, 2D game in the Unreal Engine is no easy task, but I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>

              <p style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000; font-weight: 1000; font-size: 35px; line-height: 0.05em;">WILL IT BLEND?</p>
            </aside>
            <p>My idea of a game set in an abandoned or soon to be abandoned online game was only one of many ideas that I and the other game designers on our team had come up with and slammed into a Miro Board with sticky notes.</p>
            <p>The idea was to pick a few ideas from the list, find commonalities between them and see how those commonalities would work when compiled together into a single game. The primary inspirations for our ideas came from emotions and the types that we wish for the Player to express during play, metaphors for mental/emotional issues, various robot/AI stories, etc.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>The three sticky notes coloured green are the three ideas that we, as a whole team picked out and begun to find pieces in common to form a whole.</p>
            <p>With the help of the lecturers, we were able to narrow down what the game will be like, a narrative-driven game where you play as a NPC in an unpopular online game that is expected to shutdown soon, before the shutdown, you find and converse with other NPCs, growing closer with them and finding comfort in the face of the end, while also keeping your end of game up and running.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>While the rest of the team continued with idea refinement for the then upcoming presentation, I kept a close eye on how those ideas were being developed as, being a scripter, I had to worry about the actual implementation of our ideas into the Unreal Engine, so I also did some research by watching a few tutorials on YouTube about dialogue systems, working with 2D sprites using a plugin named "PaperZD", etc.</p>
